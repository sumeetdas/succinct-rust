I document all I know about Rust programming language in this one page.

## Variables
To define an immutable variable:
```
let x = 5;
```

To define a mutable variable, add `mut` after `let`
```
let mut x = 5;
```

As you can see, mentioning data type of variable is optional, as Rust compiler can infer data type from RHS value. If you want to specify data type, you can do so as:
```
let x: i32 = 5;
```

i32 here is data type for 32-bit integer values.

## Constants
* Constants are always immutable, so can't use `mut` with them.
* Constants always require data type annotation.
* Constants can be used in any scope, including global scope.
    * They remain valid in the scope they are defined in.
* Constants can only be assigned constant values, like string or numbers and not some values computed during runtime (like result of some function call)
* To define constant:
```
const PI:f32 = 3.14;
```
* By convention, constants are named as ALL_CAPS.

## Shadowing
* You can reuse same variable name in Rust.
```
let x = 5;
let x = 2.0 * 5 as f32;
```
* In the example above, you use the same variable name `x` to create another immutable variable.
* Sometimes, this come as handy, as you don't have to think about creative variable names and re-use existing ones.
* This is not same as adding `mut` to `let` statement, as that won't allow you to assign data of different data type. So, the following would cause an error:
```
let mut x = 5;
x = 2.0 * 5 as f32; // error: expected integer, found `f32`
```

## Data Types

### Scalar Types
* A scalar type represents a single value. 
* Rust has four primary scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters.

#### Integer Type
* An integer is a number without a fractional component. 
* Example: u32. This type declaration indicates that the value itâ€™s associated with should be an unsigned integer (signed integer types start with i, instead of u) that takes up 32 bits of space.
* | Length |	Signed |	Unsigned |
  |-|-|-|
  | 8-bit |	i8 |	u8 |
  | 16-bit | i16 | u16 |
  | 32-bit | i32 | u32 |
  | 64-bit | i64| u64 |
  |128-bit|	i128|	u128|
  |arch | isize|size |
* The isize and usize types depend on the kind of computer your program is running on: 
  * 64 bits if youâ€™re on a 64-bit architecture and 
  * 32 bits if youâ€™re on a 32-bit architecture.
* | Number literals |	Example |
  |-|-|
  | Decimal|98_222|
  |Hex|	0xff|
  |Octal|	0o77|
  |Binary|	0b1111_0000|
  |Byte (u8 only)|	b'A'|
* All number literals except the byte literal allow a type suffix, such as `57u8`, and _ as a visual separator, such as `1_000`
* Integer types default to `i32`

#### Floating-Point Types 
* Two floating types: `f32` and `f64`
* Default is `f64`. E.g. in `let x = 2.0`, `x`'s data type is `f64`.

#### Boolean type
* Boolean type has two possible values - `true` or `false`.
* Booleans are one byte in size, and are specified by `bool` data type.

#### Character type
* Defined by `char`
* `char` literals are specified using single quotes
* Can save emojis into char variable: `let heart_eyed_cat = 'ðŸ˜»';`
* Can save unicode as chars: `let digit_2 = '\u{0032}';`
* Rustâ€™s char type is four bytes in size and represents a Unicode Scalar Value

### Compound Types
* Compound types can group multiple values into one type. 

#### Tuple Type
* A tuple is a general way of grouping together a number of values with a **variety of types** into one compound type. 
* Tuples have a fixed length: once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.
* Example: `let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);`
* Use pattern matching to get individual tuple values:
  ```
  let (x, y, z) = tup;
  println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
  ```
* `let (x, y, z) = tup;` is called **destructuring**, because it breakes tuple into multiple parts
* We can access a tuple element directly by using a period (.) followed by the index of the value we want to access. Eg: `let five_hundred = x.0;`

#### Array Type
* Unlike a tuple, every element of an array must have the same type.
* Arrays have fixed length.
* Eg: `let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];`
* Arrays are stored on stack
* Specify array type as follows: `let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];`
  * `i32, 5` means array elements are of type `i32` and array length is 5
* Create an array of 5 elements, all having same value 3: `let a = [3; 5];`
* Access array elements as: `let first = a[0];`
